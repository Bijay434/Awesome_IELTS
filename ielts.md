# IELTS Resources

A collection of all the great IELTS materials, tools, tips, tricks, and applications that helped me to get the following band in IELTS General Training: 
*Listening: 8, Reading: 9, Speaking: 8.5, Writing: 7.*

Contributions are always welcome! 

If you need someone to look at your letters and essay, please email it to me at aadishah74.as@gmail.com. I would try to help you in any capacity. When you send me an email, please have 'IELTS' in the subject; thus, it will be easier for me to sort out the emails and get back to you promptly.
